It interacts with the API to display messages and comments, and to allow users to create new messages and comments. It also utilizes Firebase for user authentication. It provides a front-end to perform CRUD operations against comments and messages in a visually pleasing way.It incorporates the React Router library to handle routing, and the React Bootstrap library to handle styling. Dark mode is also supported.",
